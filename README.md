Grab power-ups and bounce your way to the end!

I decided that I'd rather not have the source open source anymore as the project is coming along. The main project has already been made private and this one has been created to take its place for public feedback.

I be uploading periodic demos as stable releases are compiled!

As for this most recent update, I've taken this last night out to make a few minor updates, namely to place the actual 3d-ball-preview on the ball select screen.
